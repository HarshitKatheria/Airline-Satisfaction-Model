## Introduction

Airline customer satisfaction is crucial for the success and reputation of any airline company. Understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction can lead to targeted improvements in services, which can, in turn, enhance customer loyalty and profitability. This project aims to:

- Build a machine learning model to predict passenger satisfaction based on various factors.
- Analyze the dataset to identify key insights and trends related to airline passenger satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). It contains a collection of attributes such as flight distance, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, and more, which are used to predict customer satisfaction. 

## Installation

To run the code and analyze the dataset, you'll need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/HarshitKatheria/Airline-Satisfaction-Model.git
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Airline-Satisfaction-Model
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `Airline_Satisfaction_Model.ipynb`:

   ```
   jupyter notebook Airline_Satisfaction_Model.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to train the model and analyze the dataset.

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Here are the results:

- Accuracy: 96.30%
- Precision: 0.97%
- Recall: 0.94%
- F1-score: 0.95%
